1. Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python (1 - 15)<br>
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple game you can play with a friend. The game is played by each 
player choosing one of rock, paper, or scissors, and then the players compare their choices. It is a 
draw if both players have chosen the same thing. Otherwise, the winner is the player who has 
chosen the winning hand (rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper). To create the 
Rock, Paper and Scissors game with Python, you need to take the userâ€™s choice and then you need 
to compare it with the computer choice, and Finally print the statistics means how many times the 
user wins, how many times the computer wins and how many times they draw.
